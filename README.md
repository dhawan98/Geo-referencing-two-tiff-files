# Geo-referencing-two-tiff-files
Geo-referencing one image wrt another made easy. A tiff file contains Longitude-Latitude values, projection and the image. A lot of times, In Remote Sensing field, we may need to geo-reference two tiff files, meaning copying the Longitude and Latitude values of one file onto the other. This code can do it in fraction of minutes instead of using older methods like GIS tools to geo-reference .Tiff files.

In path1, insert the path of Tiff file which has the Latitude Longitude files. In path2, insert path of the image to be geo-referenced.
